Implemented a RESTful API method using the GET request to retrieve song information dynamically from the iTunes API. The application allows users to search for songs by entering keywords in the search bar. Upon receiving the search query, the application constructs a URL with the search term and sends a fetch request to the iTunes API. The response data is then processed and displayed on the webpage, including details such as artist name, song title, artwork, and a preview audio player for each song. The application also features functionality to pause other audio players when a new song preview is played, ensuring a smooth user experience.
